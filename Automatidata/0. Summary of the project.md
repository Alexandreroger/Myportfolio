The aim of this repository is to highlight my skills in this field. I'll be putting all my personal projects as a data analyst here.   Please note that the databases for these projects are created from scratch and do not refer to any organisation.

# Automatidata

The [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics?skipBrowseRedirect=true) concludes with a project that provides hands-on opportunities to practice knowledge I learned. These end-of-course portfolio projects build across courses to simulate the full lifecycle of a data project.

Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that predicts taxi and limousine ride durations based on location and time of day data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.
